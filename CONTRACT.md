# Team Contract

## Communication

1. *Team Meetings* Our team will meet once a week every Sunday from 4-6 PM using Discord starting on April 11. Members will rotate being the designated meeting leader, starting with elenam3. Meeting leaders will take notes in a shared Google document timestamped with appropriate dates. Meeting leaders will also be responsible for the weekly DEVELOPMENT LOG entry, which is approved by the team at the start of the following week’s meeting.

2. *Assistance* Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord. Outside of emergencies or other commitments, we commit to responding to emails within 48 hours with a goal of 12 hours. 

3. *Respect* The meeting leader for the week will make sure that all team members have the opportunity to share their opinions, contribute to meetings, and be respected by the rest of the team. All decisions will be accepted by simple majority; in the event that the sides are divided evenly, the meeting leader will make the decision. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree.

## Collaboration

1. *Work Distribution* Each week, the necessary deliverables will be determined at the team meeting, and each member will volunteer to work on one or more deliverables. When no one volunteers, a team member will be randomly assigned to work on the task with another team member randomly assigned as an advisor if advice is needed. If this leads to an unbalanced workload for the week, adjustments will be made on a case-by-case basis.

2. *Time Commitment* To ensure an equal distribution of work, each member is expected to independently work no less than two and no more than six hours per week on the project. If a deliverable ends up taking more time, the rest of the team should be pulled in to assist with the unforeseen complication, with each member taking an equal share of the workload. It is the team’s responsibility to make sure a weekly deliverable is finished by the end of the week. In the event that a team member habitually fails to complete their tasks or misses team meetings, they may be expected to explain their circumstances to the rest of the team. Based on the situation, a staff member may need to be alerted as decided on a case-by-case basis by the rest of the team.

3. *Conflict Resolution* All conflicts within the team will be resolved with an open-minded discussion between parties moderated by a team member not involved in the conflict. In the event that the parties unable to reach a resolution, the team will reach out to a staff member for assistance.
