# Development Log

## 5/2-5/12 (Week 4 to End)
This week, we focused on integrating every individual aspect of our project together. This included adding a src directory and main file that runs the parser, BFS Traversal, PageRank algorithm, and A* Traversal. We finished writing test suites for A*, PageRank, and BFS. A* and PageRank were finally merged onto the master branch. We mainly focused this week on making sure we had all the deliverables covered. We made a presentation and recorded a video of it.

## 4/25-5/1 (Week 3)

This week we were able to integrate Catch2 with almost every branch of the project. We merged the preliminary versions of BFS & parsing to the master branch. Integration of parsing and BFS is almost complete. We still need to do CMake file hierarchical integration as well as incorporate CMake with PageRank to properly build include dependencies. We also still need to merge A* and PageRank onto the master branch. 

## 4/18-4/24 (Week 2)

This week, we made progress on parsing, BFS traversal, PageRank algorithm, and A* algorithm, the four main components of our project. For Makefile and Catch2 configuration, we completed the main portion of Makefile and researched including Catch2. We completed parsing from the dataset into Node objects. We also completed a BFS traversal and wrote tests. We wrote a PageRank algorithm based on an adjacency matrix and completed the A* algorithm. Next week, we plan to include Catch2 for testing code, integrate parsing with BFS, PageRank, and A*, and write tests.

## 4/11-4/17 (Week 1)

We found datasets for our initial project (course scheduler) and met to assign parsing and graph formation to team members. However, when we received proposal feedback, we decided to rewrite our proposal with a new project with counsel from Adit, our Project Mentor. After meeting to discuss our new project with railroads and write our proposal, we found datasets that represent the edges between railroad stations and contain location information about each station.
